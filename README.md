## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a working etch-a-sketch in JavaScript from scratch. 

## Skill to be demonstrated
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Tools used
- VSCode
- Live Server
- Git / GitHub

## To do 
- [ ] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs (make them with JavaScript and insert into "container")
- [ ] Setup a hover effect so the grid divs change color on mouse over leaving a pixilated trail through the grid like a pen
- [ ] Add a button to the top of the screen to shake the etch-a-sketch (clear screen) and pop up asking the user how many squares per side to be in the new grid. New grid should cover the same amount of space. Recommended to limit to 100x100 squares. 
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Instead of changing color from black to white, have it choose a random color with 10% saturation increasing +10% each pass until it's completely black.
